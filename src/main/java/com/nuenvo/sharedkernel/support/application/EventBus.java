/**
 * Applications persist events in an event store, which is a database of events.
 * The store has an API for adding and retrieving an entityâ€™s events.
 * The event store also behaves like a message broker.
 * It provides an API that enables services to subscribe to events.
 * When a service saves an event in the event store, it is delivered to all interested subscribers.
